The main goal of the project is to find matching dots in two pictures of the same place but from different angles by using the algorithms.\n
The jupyter notebook cantains among other things, an implementation of KNN and ANN algorithms and implementation of LSH data structure.\n
The JPG file are the picture on the same place from different angles.\n
